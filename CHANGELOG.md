# Changelog

## [0.9.27] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Wiki CRUD Support**: Added the `delete_wiki_page` tool for complete page deletion capabilities from the Wiki vault, completing full CRUD support.
- **Wiki Grep & Glob Support**: Integrated robust recursive glob pattern matching with the new `glob_find_wiki` tool using the `globset` crate, complementing existing regex (Grep) search capabilities in `search_wiki`.
- **Serve Mode Dynamic Workspace API**: Introduced dedicated REST endpoints (`GET /api/workspaces`, `POST /api/workspaces/add`, and `POST /api/workspaces/select`) to enable programmatic listing, adding, and selecting of workspaces in server mode, bringing feature parity with CLI mode.
- **Dynamic Active Workspace Autocomplete**: Replaced the hardcoded autocomplete in CLI mode with a dynamic resolver that reads registered workspaces from `config.toml` and falls back to the current directory, supporting absolute and relative paths under the `@` prefix.

### Changed

- **Autocomplete Performance Optimization**: Pruned common heavy development and build directories (including `.git`, `node_modules`, `target`, `dist`, `.venv`, and `build`) using `WalkDir::filter_entry` in the autocomplete resolver, making path suggestion retrieval instantaneous.
- **Strict Workspace Boundary for Autocomplete**: Enforced that the autocomplete walks strictly within the active workspace root, stripping out leading absolute path prefixes and resolving all completed entries relative to the workspace boundary for consistency and sandbox integrity.
